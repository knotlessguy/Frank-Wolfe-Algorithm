Implementation of the Frank Wolfe Algorithm for transportation network analysis

The quad function is a function from an old Fortran library. It works by judging by the flatness and slope of the function it is integrating how to treat the step size it uses for numerical integration in order to maximize efficiency. What this means is that you may get slightly different answers from one region to the next even if they're analytically the same.
